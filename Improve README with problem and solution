# Post Deployment Health Check

## Problem Statement
In many production environments, faulty deployments can go unnoticed and later result in high-severity incidents.

## Solution
This project demonstrates a simple automated health check performed immediately after deployment to validate application health and prevent faulty releases.

## Key Idea
- Automate post-deployment validation
- Fail deployments early if health checks fail
- Reduce incident recurrence and MTTR
